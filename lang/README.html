<p>Blank WordPress Pot allows developers to have a great starting point for their translations&#39; pot files and translators an explanation how to use the file.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Developers and translators sometimes get a little confused when they want to start translating their WordPress files. Blank WordPress Pot provides the starting point to create the ready to translate pot file.
In a few clicks your WordPress plugin or extension will be ready to incorporate your translated strings. No more default.po or .pot without the right settings.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-files-include">Features of the files include</h3>
<ul>
<li>Right properties set (utf-8, plurals).</li>
<li>Right path set.</li>
<li>All keywords included.</li>
<li>A how-to file for translators to explain how to use the pot file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work-">How does it work?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create the &quot;languages&quot; folder right at the base of your root folder.</li>
<li>Put Blank-WordPress.pot and the how-to file inside.</li>
<li>Rename Blank-WordPress.pot with the slug of your plugin or extension.</li>
<li>Open the file with Poedit.</li>
<li>In Catalog -&gt; Properties -&gt; Translation properties: change the properties to match your WordPress file name -&gt; ok.</li>
<li>Push the update button in poedit main ui to fetch and update the translated strings.</li>
<li>Save (if a notice ask you to pick a language just pick &quot;none of this&quot;). Use your textdomain name if it&#39;s a plugin or only en_US for the name of your file.</li>
<li>Exit and that&#39;s it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the translators have a pot file ready to be used, and an HowTo to tell them what to do in case of need.
No more hassle for you and for them...</p>
